# Joy of Elixir - Lovely lists?
## Chapter 3

### Resume

Lists are used to store many elements. The difference between lists and tuples is that lists
have dynamic lengths and tuples have a fixed-size, that's why we use lists to manipulate elements.

Example of lists:

```
iex> ages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
iex> names = ["Laura", "Jose", "Valim"]
```
