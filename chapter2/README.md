# Joy of Elixir - Now, where did I put that value?
## Chapter 2

The focus of this chapter is to understand how we can declare variables on Elixir and use
their values to perform operations.

Covered topics:
- Declare or re-declare variables
- String interpolation

### [Exercise 1]('./exercice1.ex') - If we store the number of seconds in a day using this code: seconds = 86400, calculate using that variable how many hours there are in 30 days.

### [Exercice 2]('./exercice2.ex') - Create a variable called name, store a string in it and place the value of that variable in another string.

### [Exercice 3]('./exercice3.ex') - The line 5 / "four" shows an error. Think about why this error might happen.
